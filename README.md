# Bilibili One-click Add to "Watch Later"
### Automatically add videos from followed UPs released near a specified date to "Watch Later"
Use Login.py to implement QR code login on Bilibili to obtain cookies, which are used to read the user's "Watch Later" list and the latest videos published by followed UPs.
In units of pages, add videos within a custom number of days to "Watch Later" and save the list of videos that were not added to "Watch Later".

**Compilation**：Please use pip install to install the required libraries (note that cv2 should be installed via pip install opencv-python, and pay attention to the case of cv2).

**Usage**：Place AddToView.exe in a separate folder, double-click to run, and if necessary, add a shortcut to the desktop. Please manually unpdate your cookie file before fixing Login.py.
